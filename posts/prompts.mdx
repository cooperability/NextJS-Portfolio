**Note**: These prompts are best used with Anthropic's Claude, which I prefer to ChatGPT for its longer context window and lower tendency to hallucinate when dealing with large inputs. Since I primarily use genAI for learning, I optimize these prompts for maximum context and accuracy.
___
<br />
**Generate Cover Letter (Requires a job description🟢, resume🔴, and previous cover letter🔵)**
<br />
I have attached documents 🟢, 🔴, and 🔵(names of documents). Write a cover letter for the job in attachment 🟢, using the contents of resume 🔴 and the writing style of cover letter🔵. Don’t add any experience that isn’t specifically included in 🔴. Use a long-short-short-short-long-short-long-short-short sentence structure. Please don’t be yappy,  but maintain professionalism and emphasize parts of my profile that would be especially valuable to this company.

**Book Summary (best with self-help, advice, or knowledge-based books)**
<br />
I have uploaded [XY Author]’s [XY Text]. I need an extracted summary from you containing all actionable advice/knowledge within this text. I will never read the source text, but I want to enjoy 100% of the academic, social, and experiential benefits the text confers. The following are tags for 
<br />
**PS** = Paraphrased Summary by LLM
<br />
**DQ**  = Direct Quotes, VERBATIM excerpts WITH PAGE NUMBER
<br />
**CS/IE** = Case Study or Illustrative Example: a story or narrative the text provides which is intended to evidence a certain argument or point therein. These should typically be paraphrased and marked with a page number for further investigation, but occasionally there are **CS/IE**s which can be entirely contained in a DQ of a few sentences. In these cases DQ is preferable.
<br />
Your summary should have the following 4-part structure:
<br />
- **Five-paragraph overall summary (PS)**
    - 1 paragraph: intro + roadmap, structure of the text and arguments
    - 3 paragraphs: three major movements from the work demonstrating its segues between major arguments, & important subpoints in each argument
    - conclusion, distilled review of overall argument
- **Ten central case studies (CS/IE)s. (PS)**
    - Include less than five sentences per **CS/IE** explaining its structure/narrative, showing context in the work, and highlight whether it’s referenced multiple times.
    - Connect CS/IEs to actionable advice by subpoint if possible
- **Ten bottom-line pieces of concise, actionable advice (DQ preffered, PS ok)**
    - whether through author’s direct recommendation or implicit illustration e.g. “successful/unsuccessful examples have typically included THIS course of action: …”
    - Include sub-bullet **CS/IE** here WHENEVER available

<br />

- **Ten of the book’s best quotes (DQ), selected on the criteria**:
    1. communicates a central point of the text concisely
    2. is dramatic, well-written and/or memorable
    3. illustrates author’s unique perspective/experience well
<br />

A few final ABSOLUTE RULES:
    1. CLEARLY mark what is (**DQ),** (**PS) and (CS/IE[either DQ or PS])** for all bullet points of the summary so as to make the summary properly attributable.
    2. If uncertain about any part of the reduction/summarization process, ask me about specific implementations instead of assuming any particular behavior. This includes what content/themes/chapters to focus the summary on.
    3. Points which are already too nuanced/concise to be effectively summarized should be marked with page numbers so that I can peruse the book.
    4. After you complete this first response, give a few options for drilldown prompts which would allow me to further investigate the depth of the text using your (the LLM’s) help.
