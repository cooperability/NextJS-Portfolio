title: "üìùCompose PRD for Codebase"
date: "2025-01-06"

Based on the code/details here, compose a PRD for this project:

1. The application's purpose, broadly, and how each component contributes. One paragraph summary; bullet points for components.
2. The entire tech stack. Bullet points. Outlined & cleanly indented to demonstrate frontend, backend, database components. One bullet point/sentence per library, framework or piece of tech.
3. The application's complete data schema, including nested projects, database models, and inherited types. If possible, include flowcharts for common user actions and the data processes they initiate (user clicks button ‚Üí data processed ‚Üí response returned, etc)
4. CI/CD and process flow, procedure/protocol details for things like making migrations and migrating.

This PRD should have both broad topic coverage and extreme specificity where possible, as I will use it as a jumping-off point for countless new chats.
