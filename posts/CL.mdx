**(Requires a job descriptionğŸŸ¢, resumeğŸ”´, and previous cover letterğŸ”µ)**
<br />
I have attached documents ğŸŸ¢, ğŸ”´, and ğŸ”µ(names of documents). Write a cover letter for the job in attachment ğŸŸ¢, using the contents of resume ğŸ”´ and the writing style of cover letterğŸ”µ. Donâ€™t add any experience that isnâ€™t specifically included in ğŸ”´. Use a long-short-short-short-long-short-long-short-short sentence structure. Please donâ€™t be yappy,  but maintain professionalism and emphasize parts of my profile that would be especially valuable to this company.
