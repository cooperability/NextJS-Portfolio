title: "📝Summarize this chat as a new prompt"
date: "2025-01-07"

Distill the insights from this chat into a condensed, organized and informative summary which could be seamlessly appended to this project’s documentation🟢. A data point from this chat should be prioritized for the summary when it is:

A) An insight uncovered through this chat which would be difficult to uncover WITHOUT repeating this chat. 

B) Prior-posterior beliefs about the system which have changed over the course of this chat, yielding a new understanding than when we began.

C) (optional) Changes made to the code within this chat, as well as a short explanation for why each change was made.

Do NOT include anything already included in the Documentation🟢. Again, your goal is to harvest insights that are HIGHLY UNIQUE, USEFUL, SPECIFIC, and DIFFICULT TO UNCOVER and leave all else behind.
