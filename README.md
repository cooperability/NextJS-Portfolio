# Co-Operability

This personal website runs on a Next frontend on Vercel. I'm parting with IPFS because it's too expensive to keep a responsive page there, although my original ultralight IPFS site will continue running.

Visit the live webpage at [cooperability.com](https://www.cooperability.com).
